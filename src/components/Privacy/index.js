        "Spotify with Friends" was built to give Spotify listeners and artists a
        better way to share what music their friends are listening to, as well
        as explore new songs and artists. We are dedicated to respecting users'
        privacy and personal information by providing transparency into our
        privacy practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "Spotify with Friends" will not store any of your information if you
          do not create an account. If you are registered and choose to post,
          however, you will be submitting information to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you register on our website, we will collect information readily
          available from your Spotify account. This information is only used to
          build a stronger sense of community and identity between users on our
          website.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you choose to post, anything you post will be available for anyone
          registered with an account to see. Posting is entirely optional and
          while your posts may help other users discover new music, we want you
          to understand that you will also be broadcasting your listening
          history to the public.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, if you choose to save any posts or songs, we will store that
          information for your use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We cannot guarantee that your data will be safely stored, as we do not
        have the capacity to implement the necessary security and encryption
        into our website. The majority of our services can be used without
        registering and without giving us any of your information. Thank you for
        reading and we hope that you understand the implications of using our
        website.
